# Quantitative Trading
This repository showcases a collection of past projects and simplified examples of quantitative trading strategies. While most of the strategies here are either outdated or intentionally basic, they serve to demonstrate core concepts and coding approaches Iâ€™ve used in the field.

## What's Inside
- **Automated Technical Analysis:** Early explorations in generating trading signals using technical indicators.

- **Machine Learning:** Simple examples applying machine learning techniques to market data.

**Note:** These are not production-level or currently profitable strategies. For obvious reasons, working strategies that generate alpha cannot be shared publicly.

## My Current Work
Today, I build significantly more advanced models, including deep learning pipelines, custom feature engineering, and hybrid strategies that adapt dynamically to market regimes. I'm happy to discuss them in private or during interviews under appropriate confidentiality.
