# Quantitative Trading

This repository contains a curated collection of past projects that explore various quantitative trading concepts and derivative pricing models. These projects were developed for academic, research, and personal experimentation purposes. Some were intentionally simplified for clarity, and none are currently used in production.

## üß† What's Inside

### 1. Legacy Technical Analysis Strategies
**Folder:** `1_Legacy_TA_Strategies_Trading_Suite`

- Early rule-based trading systems using common technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
- Backtested and optimized in Python on historical crypto price data.
- Demonstrates basic signal generation and risk management.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting and ML Signal Generation
**Folder:** `2_Time_Series_Forecasting_and_Trading_Signal_ML`

- Experimental models applying machine learning to financial time series.
- Includes use of ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forests, and custom feature pipelines.
- Built on Solana and cryptocurrency datasets.
- Focus on classification of future price direction and signal reliability.

### 3. C++ Derivatives Pricing Projects
**Folder:** `3_C++_Derivatives_Pricing_Projects`

- A comprehensive suite of C++ programs for pricing and hedging financial derivatives.
- Includes:

  - European and American option pricing using finite difference methods and Black-Scholes PDEs.
  - Monte Carlo simulation for Asian and path-dependent options.
  - Analytical Black-Scholes implementation with replicating strategy calculation.
  - Custom grid generation and payoff classes with reusable abstractions.
  - Extensive unit testing and mathematical validation.

- Covers both theoretical finance and numerical implementation, including advanced grid-based methods and stochastic modeling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

None of the strategies here are production-ready or currently profitable. For confidentiality and competitive reasons, my active strategies and infrastructure are not public.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Current Focus

I currently work on:

- Deep learning-based models for regime-switching and volatility forecasting.
- Hybrid frameworks combining statistics, signal processing, and machine learning.
- Robust backtesting, risk analytics, and dynamic portfolio allocation engines.
